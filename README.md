## Chapter 1

Homework 1.1

For this section's assessment, you will fill out the functions defined in `interface.js`. These functions will query a collection of movies - the data in the movies collection will look like what you see in the `movies.json` file.

In order to complete this section's assessment, you will have to make the tests in `test.js` pass. 
To run the tests, run `npm install `and then `npm test`. 

You will notice the tests fail. In keeping with this section's emphasis on automation, we recommend you use npm run watch to re-run your tests every time you change the `interface.js` file. 
Once the tests succeed, npm run watch will terminate and print a "secret code" consisting of a short phrase: `the mean stack awakens` 
Copy this code into the assessment page in your browser to complete this assessment.
